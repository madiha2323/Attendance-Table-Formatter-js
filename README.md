# Attendance Table Formatter (JavaScript)

This repository showcases a simple HTML file for visualizing an attendance sheet over a month. The table provides student IDs, names, and daily attendance records with 'P' (Present), 'A' (Absent), and 'L' (Late) labels. The JavaScript code incorporated in the HTML file elevates the display by introducing formatting to the table cells based on attendance status.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. View the attendance records with 'P' for Present, 'A' for Absent, and 'L' for Late.
3. Activate the "Apply Formatting" button to highlight 'A' and 'L' records in red and orange, respectively.
4. Employ the "Clear Formatting" button to revert the formatting to its default state.
